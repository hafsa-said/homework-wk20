The mapper.py and reducer.py file with the code is attached in repo

*How to run the program*
- We use git bash or Visual Studio Code to run the program
- Since we are using a file not a string, we used 'cat' to concatenate
- Next we run the file we want
- Then we insert a pipe, which allows in to pipe in first our mapper.py program and then the reducer.py program
- We can use sort in the middle with a pipe as well
- Finally we resort everything by count
- The -g at the end allows us to sort anything that "looks like a number" as a number
